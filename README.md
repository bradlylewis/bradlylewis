### Welcome to my github! ğŸ‘‹
#### Description
~~I'm a network analyst.~~ I'm a software developer. I've spent the first 9 years of my adult life in Network Engineering, but I look to spend the remainder in Software Developement. The thing that drives me is my yearning desire to succeed at everything I do, whether it's something productive or something as simple as just being a good person.
